# Image_to_text_to_Speech
The Image to Text to Speech Converter is an assistive technology project that extracts text content from images and converts it into natural-sounding speech. The system integrates three main modules: image processing, optical character recognition (OCR), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
