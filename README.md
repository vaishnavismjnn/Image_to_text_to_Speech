# Image_to_text_to_Speech
The Image to Text to Speech Converter is an assistive technology project that extracts text content from images and converts it into natural-sounding speech. The system integrates three main modules: image processing, optical character recognition (OCR), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
Image Input – Users can upload or capture images containing printed or handwritten text (e.g., books, signboards, documents).

Text Extraction (OCR) – The system uses OCR technology (such as Tesseract OCR or EasyOCR) to detect and extract textual content from images.

Text Preprocessing – The extracted text is cleaned, formatted, and optimized for speech synthesis (removing noise, correcting errors).

Text-to-Speech Conversion – The processed text is converted into natural human-like speech using a TTS engine  pyttsx3

Audio Output – saved as an audio file for offline listening
